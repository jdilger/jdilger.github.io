      <description>Hello world! This is my very first post to this mini resume-blog site. Primarily, I hope to use this to maintain a working version of my resume, but I will also use it to display some of my side projects “&amp;amp;” hopefully teach some interesting remote sensing or GIS techniques along the way.
This site is generated using Hugo, a static site generator, and is being hosted via GitHub. I’d suggest the combo to anyone who is willing to delve a little into HTML/CSS and likes being cheap.</description>
