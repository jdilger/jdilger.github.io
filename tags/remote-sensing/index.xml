      <description>I am a Geoinformatics fellow with NASA DEVELOP. DEVELOP is part of NASA Earth science program, under the Applied science and the Capacity building programs. I provide remote sensing and GIS technical support to ~70 project teams a year as well as help facilitate any code or software release. DEVELOP projects apply Earth observations to the application areas of Agriculture &amp;amp; Food Security, Disasters, Ecological Forecasting, Energy, Health and Air Quality, Urban Development, Transportation &amp;amp; Infrastructure and Water Resources.</description>

      <description>Hello world! This is my very first post to this mini resume-blog site. Primarily, I hope to use this to maintain a working version of my resume, but I will also use it to display some of my side projects &amp;amp; hopefully teach some interesting remote sensing or GIS techniques along the way.
This site is generated using Hugo, a static site generator, and is being hosted via GitHub. I’d suggest the combo to anyone who is willing to delve a little into HTML/CSS and likes being cheap.</description>
